In a world increasingly driven by technology, security and public safety are paramount concerns. 
This knife detection project addresses these concerns through the implementation of a sophisticated system powered by the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm and OpenCV. 
The project focuses on real-time object detection specifically knives, utilizing computer vision to enhance surveillance capabilities.

Models:
Pretrained models are provided by TensorFlow Hub and the TensorFlow Model Garden

Training and dataset:
Trained on UCF101 for video action classification

Inference:
All Models use TensorFlow 2 with Keras for inference and training.

Solution:

1.  Real-time detection of knives : By employing advanced computer vision algorithms, we aim to accurately identify and track knives within the visual frame, providing immediate alerts to potential threats in monitored environments.
2.  Action recognition within video footage : We analyze the actions distinguishing between harmless activities and potentially threatening behaviors.
3.  Facial recognition and matching against criminal databases: Leveraging facial recognition technology, we swiftly identify individuals present in the video footage and cross-reference them with law enforcement databases. This integration empowers security personnel to promptly identify persons of interest, including known criminals or suspects,
